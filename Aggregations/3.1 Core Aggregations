# Core Aggregations

## $lookup

- It is used to combine information from 2 collections. It's like left outer join(SQL).
- Query syntax:
```bash
$lookup: {
  from: < collection to join > // it should not be sharded and should be present in the same database,
  localField: <field from the input documents>, // a field in working collection where we express the aggregation command that we want to compare to
  foriegnField: < field from the documents of the "from" collection >, // field want to compare from in the collection we specified in from
  as: <output array field> // all matches will be put into an array. If this field is already present in the doc, that will be overwritten.
}
```
- This aggregate query performs a strict equality comparision.
- Eg query:
```bash
$lookup: {
  from: "coll2",
  localField: "field1 from coll1",
  foreignField: "field2 from coll2",
  as: "any name",
}
```
- `$lookup` retrieves the entire document not just the fields that matched or specified.
