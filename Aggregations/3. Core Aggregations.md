# Core Aggregations

## $group

- The field we should remember is _id. The expression or expressions we specify to _id becomes the criteria the group stage uses to categorize and bundle documents together.
- We can specify the different arguments in the group.
- Eg query:
```bash
{ $group: {_id: <matching/grouping criteria>,
     fieldName: <accumulator expression>,
     ....
  }
}
```
- Eg:
```bash
db.coll.aggregate([
  { 
    $group: {
      _id: "$field1",
      count: {$sum: 1}
  }
}])
```
- Everytime group categorizes a doc for us, the sum expression gets called.
- After grouping, sometimes we get `null` at the output. This is because, the field may be missing in the document itself.
- However we need to sanitize the incoming data and clean/filter the proper data.
- `$cond` ==> `[expression, value if true, value if false]`
- How to group all the docs instead of subset?
- Eg:
```bash
db.coll.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null or "",
      count: {$sum: 1}
    }
}])
```
- `$group` can be used multiple times in a pipeline.
- Another eg query for ref:
```bash
db.coll.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {'field1': {$gt: 0} },
  }, {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      avg: {$avg: "$field1"},
    }
  }
])
```
- The above query is computing the average of `field1` for all the documents which are matching the given criteria.

## $project with accumulator expressions

- Available accumulator expressions are:
     - $sum, $avg, $max, $min, $stdDevPop, $stdDevSam
- These operate over an array in the document, they donot carry values over all docs.
- Expressions have no memory between documents.
- May still have to use $reduce or $map for more complex operations.
- Eg query:
```bash
db.coll.aggregate([
     {$project: {_id: 0, max_temp: {$max: "$field.temp"}
               }
     }
])
```
- The above query returns what is the max temp in the collection.
```
{'max_temp': 100}
```
- Another eg query:
```
db.coll.aggregate([
     {
          $project: {
               _id: 0,
               avg: {$avg: "$field1.num"},
               deviation: {$stdDevPop: "$field.num"},
               total: {$sum: "$fields.num"}
          }
     }
])
```

## $unwind stage

- `$unwind` lists unwind in an array field, creating a new document for every entry where the field value is now each entry.
- Let's say if in a document, if a field is an array with n elements. If we use `$unwind` on that field, we will get n entries(docs).
- Eg query:
```
db.coll.aggregate([ {$unwind: field} ]) ==> short form

db.coll.aggregate([ ==> long form
     {
          $unwind: {
               path: field path,
               includeArrayIndex: string, ==> This will create another doc with whatever name we specify, with the value set to the index of the element in the original array.
               preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: bool ==> True will create an array with an empty array with the value specified in the path as either null, missing or an empty array.
          },
     }
])
```
- If the documents are too large and if we need to use `$unwind`, the memory consumption would be high. As always match early, retain only the information needed with project and we can use `allowDiskUse` if needed.
