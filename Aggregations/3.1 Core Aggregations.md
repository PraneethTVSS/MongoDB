# Core Aggregations

## $lookup

- It is used to combine information from 2 collections. It's like left outer join(SQL).
- Query syntax:
```bash
$lookup: {
  from: < collection to join > // it should not be sharded and should be present in the same database,
  localField: <field from the input documents>, // a field in working collection where we express the aggregation command that we want to compare to
  foriegnField: < field from the documents of the "from" collection >, // field want to compare from in the collection we specified in from
  as: <output array field> // all matches will be put into an array. If this field is already present in the doc, that will be overwritten.
}
```
- This aggregate query performs a strict equality comparision.
- Eg query:
```bash
$lookup: {
  from: "coll2",
  localField: "field1 from coll1",
  foreignField: "field2 from coll2",
  as: "any name",
}
```
- `$lookup` retrieves the entire document not just the fields that matched or specified.

## $graphLookup

- It allows users/developers to combine there datasets with graph or graph-like operations.
- `$graphLookup` will look into the docs recursively with a defined relationship.
- It's like `$lookup` but with little variations.
- Eq query:
```bash
db.coll.aggregate([{$match: {'name': 'Eliot'}}, {$graphLookup: {from: 'parent_reference', 'startWith': "$_id", connectFromField: '_id', connectToField: 'reports_to', as: 'all_reps'}}])
```
- It gives the information about a particular node it connects to(like tree).
